HR Analytics Report: Workforce Insights

1. Introduction
This report looks closely at our company's employee information. Our main goal is to understand who works here, how well they perform, how happy they are, and why some people leave. By understanding these things, our HR team can make smarter choices to manage our talent, keep good employees, and make the company healthier overall.

This analysis uses information from 311 employee records. This includes details like age, pay, how they perform, and their job status.


2. Getting the Data Ready
Before we could look at the data, we had to clean it up to make sure it was correct and consistent. Here's what we did:

Fixed Missing Dates: In the "DateofTermination" column, we removed phrases like "N/A-StillEmployed" and left them blank so we could correctly calculate how long people worked.

Cleaned Up Names: We removed extra spaces from text like employee names and department names.

Set Up Data Types: We changed dates (like birth dates and hire dates) into a standard date format. We also made sure numbers used for categories (like department IDs) were treated correctly.

Checked for Duplicates: We made sure every employee had a unique ID, so there were no duplicate records.

4. What We Learned & What We Should Do
What We Learned: The Production department is crucial, but it also has the lowest average salary and a lot of employees.

What We Should Do: Look closely at how happy and involved employees in the Production department are. Check if their pay is competitive compared to other companies to help keep them from leaving.

What We Learned: Indeed, LinkedIn, and employee referrals are great ways to hire people.

What We Should Do: Keep investing in online hiring tools. Make our employee referral program even better with more rewards, as it's a good and affordable way to find quality candidates.

What We Learned: People often leave because they want new opportunities, better pay, or are generally unhappy.

What We Should Do: Create clear paths for employees to grow in their careers so they can see a future here. Also, have regular "stay interviews" (talks with employees who are still here) to find out what makes them unhappy before they decide to leave.

What We Learned: About 10% of our employees "Need Improvement" or are on a "PIP."

What We Should Do: Improve how we manage performance. Give managers better training on how to coach and help employees who aren't performing well. Early help can turn things around and prevent people from being fired later.


5. Conclusion
This report gives us a clear picture of our company's human resources based on data. While our workforce is generally healthy and engaged, there are important areas we need to focus on to improve, especially keeping employees, helping them grow their careers, and supporting specific departments. By taking action on these findings, HR can help build a stronger and more effective organization.
